# Railway Programming

After some years of programming, I realised that people really like railway programming, for example:

| Language | Original | Railway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Javascript | Callback hell | Promise |
| Javascript | Promise hell | [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) |
| Javascript | if else return | [no else return](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-else-return) |
| Haskell | Nested pattern matching | [do-notation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation) |
| Rust | Nested pattern matching | [question mark operator](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-else-return) |

Generally, people prefer the left pattern over the right pattern:

| Railway | Nested trees |
| :--- | :--- |
| \[TODO: Illustration\] | \[TODO: Illustration\] |

This is actually not a coincidence, because people tends to read the left part in a straight line, this might be one of the reason people like the railway programming style.

Therefore, KK will embrace this style of programming.
